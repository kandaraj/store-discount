#### You didn't tell me how to open this?

This solution is developed in VS2015, so I guess you will need that or higher VS2017, although, I didn't test in later version, M$ assured it is backward compatible.

#### I will look at the code later, but i am keen run the program.

This solution contains only class libs, and does not have an UI :(

#### So, how do I run?

I have made the test fixtures, you can run them on using VS2015. Right click on **Store.Test** and run all tests. If required, change the test case with different inputs.
